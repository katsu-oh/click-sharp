# Click Sharp: Effortless C# code runner

Ever wished you could run C# code like a script in a default operating system environment?  
This JScript-based tool offers the following approach.

## Usage
1. Copy the [ClickSharp.jse](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/katsu-oh/click-sharp/refs/heads/main/ClickSharp.jse) file to a desired location.
1. Rename ClickSharp.jse to reflect the intended program name (e.g., ClickSharp.jse → Hello.jse).
1. Double-click the renamed .jse file. This action will automatically generate a boilerplate C# source file, compile it, and run the resulting program.
1. Modify the generated C# source file as required.
1. Double-click the .jse file again to run the updated program. If the compiled .exe file is outdated, it will be rebuilt automatically.

You can modify C# code and re-run it with a simple double-click.  
It feels just like a script.
